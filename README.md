This repository contains a collection of Python scripts focusing on the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and fundamental Data Structures.
It serves as a personal practice log for mastering inheritance patterns and graph representations.

Contents
1. Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance)
The repository includes practical examples of the four major types of inheritance in Python:
Single Inheritance: Basic Parent-Child relationship (e.g., Employee -> Manager).
Multilevel Inheritance: Chain of inheritance (e.g., Person -> Student -> Graduate).
Multiple Inheritance: A child class inheriting from multiple parent classes (e.g., Academic & Cocoricular -> Student).
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple child classes inheriting from a single parent (e.g., Person -> Undergraduate & Graduate).
Since your code covers both Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures (Graphs), your README should act as a clear map for anyone (including your future self) looking at the repository.
Here is a professional template you can copy and paste into your README.md file:
